Introduction To Database Management Systems (Lab 6)

Problem: 
Problem Part 1. 
Write mySQL code to:
(a). Introduce a new column to your table snufaculty called ”joinYear” and set appropriate
values for all records. Now the columns facultyQualification and joiYear are dependent
on facultyName and have multiple redundant entries in snufaculty. create a new table
furtherInfoFaculty that now contains facultyName, facultyQualification and JoinYear
to reduce total size of the database.
(b). Can you reduce dependencies in other tables and create new tables furtherInfoStudents
and furtherInfoCourses?
(c). Create a VIEW that displays the cartesian join of all three tables (all info).
(d). Create a STORED PROCEDURE that takes as input facultyName as fname (type var-
char) ,and Creates a VIEW by the name fnameTempView that displays facultyName,
totalCourses (number of courses he has taken till date) and totalStudents (number of
total students under that faculty, ever).
